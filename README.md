# object-on-matrix

The program simulates a point shaped object moving on a table. It takes as input different commands to turn or move the object. The purpose of the task was to use object-oriented
design to give the program a good structure that is easy to extend.

**Run instructions**

Use the terminal to run main in CommandInvoker, then input the tables size, the objects starting position, and the commands separated by spaces in the terminal.

Example using a table with width and height 4, starting position (1, 1) and the commands 2, 3 och 0: 4 4 1 1 2 3 0
